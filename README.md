# Introduction
The Fashion Recommendation System is designed to enhance the online shopping experience by suggesting clothing items similar to the ones users are interested in. By using transfer learning for feature extraction and a KNN model for similarity matching, the system provides accurate and efficient recommendations.

# Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
Similarity Matching: Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find and recommend similar clothing items.
Interactive Interface: Easy-to-use interface for uploading and receiving recommendations.   

# Installation
To set up the Fashion Recommendation System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-recommendation-system.git
   cd fashion-recommendation-system


2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`

4. Install dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Run the application:

   python app.py

# Usage
Upload an image: Use the provided interface to upload an image of a clothing item.
Get Recommendations: The system will process the image and return a list of similar items.
Explore Results: View the recommended items and their details.

# Model Architecture
The Fashion Recommendation System employs the following architecture:

Transfer Learning: Uses a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet50) to extract features from the input images.
Feature Extraction: The CNN model processes the images and outputs feature vectors.
KNN Model: These feature vectors are then fed into a KNN model to find and rank the most similar images in the dataset.
